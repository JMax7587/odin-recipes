            <h3>Description</h3>
                <p>Everyone seems to love those crispy, crusty bits of cheese that drip over the edge of a pizza, which is 
                why I've wanted to do a snack video featuring just that for many years.</p>
            <h5>INGREDIENTS:</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li>4 ounces low-moisture mozzarella cheese</li>
                    <li>4 ounces provolone cheese</li>
                    <li>2 ounces Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese</li>
                    <li>1/2 cup prepared pizza sauce</li>
                    <li>30 slices pepperoni</l>
                </ul>
            <h3>Steps:</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a 13x18-inch,half-sheets
                        pan with parchment paper.
                    </li>
                    <p></p> <!--This is only for make some space between steps-->
                    <li>
                        Grate provolone and mozzarella cheeses with the larger side of a box grater into 
                        a large bowl. Use the smaller side and grate in Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese. Toss 
                        with your hands to combine.
                    </li>
                    <p></p><!--This is only for make some space between steps-->
                    <li>
                        Scoop tablespoonfuls of the cheese mixture into 12 circular piles on the prepared 
                        baking sheet, making sure you're getting all three cheeses in each scoop. Top each 
                        circle with about Â¾ teaspoon pizza sauce, then place a slice of pepperoni on top.
                    </li>
                    <p></p><!--This is only for make some space between steps-->
                    <li>
                        Bake in the center of the preheated oven until melted and sizzling, 12 to 15 minutes.
                    </li>
                    <p></p><!--This is only for make some space between steps-->
                    <li>
                        Remove parchment paper and chips to a wire rack to cool. Line the baking sheet with a 
                        fresh sheet of parchment paper.
                    </li>
                    <p></p><!--This is only for make some space between steps-->
                    <li>
                        Repeat Steps 3 to 5 to bake remaining 18 chips.
                    </li>
                    <p></p><!--This is only for make some space between steps-->
                    <li>
                        Let chips cool to room temperature, 15 to 20 minutes. Remove from the parchment paper 
                        and serve.
